## abl_complexes

This directory contains ABL1-TKI complexes that were generated with KinoML ([commit](https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml/commit/f0b3b36d49a6dba6a2544bf42ba40590b49837f4)). The procedure and observations can be found in `notebooks/abl_complex_modeling.iypnb`.

## hauser_mutations

This csv-file contains experimental ddG values for the effect of mutations on TKI binding to ABL1. The file was prepared from the supplementary material from [Hauser 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0075-x).
