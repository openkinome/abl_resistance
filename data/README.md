## abl_complexes

This directory contains ABL1-TKI complexes that were generated with KinoML ([commit](https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml/commit/f0b3b36d49a6dba6a2544bf42ba40590b49837f4)). The procedure is the same as in `notebooks/abl_complex_modeling.iypnb`.

## abl_complexes_with_water

This directory contains ABL1-TKI complexes that were generated with KinoML ([commit](https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml/commit/730889649d3e5780d3e4a2eaa616fe8fd850cdd8)). The procedure and observations can be found in `notebooks/abl_complex_modeling.iypnb`.

## atp complexes
This directory contains a modeled structure of ABL1 in complex with ATP as well as a prepared structure of 5DNR which was used for generating the ABL1 ATP complex.
